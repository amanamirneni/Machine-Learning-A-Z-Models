This file contains all machine learning models implementations along with datasets.The whole file is divided in to 10 parts they are

1.Data processing tools:-which contains the necessary tools for building all machine learning models.

2.Regression:-Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

3.Classification:-Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

4.Clustering:-Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering you donâ€™t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings you would have never thought of otherwise.

5.Association Rule Learning:-This helps to figure out people who bought also bought ... That is what Association Rule Learning will help us figure out.

6.Reinforcement Learning:-Reinforcement Learning is a powerful branch of Machine Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time t is considered to decide which action to take at time t + 1. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through trial and error.

7.Natural Language Processing:-It is about model understanding Natural Human Language.

8.Deep Learning:-Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. Deep Learning models can be used for a variety of complex tasks.My file contains one ANN and one CNN model.

9.Dimension Reduction:- A method for representing a given dataset using a lower number of features (i.e. dimensions) while still capturing the original data's meaningful properties.

10.Model Selection and Boosting:-This contains how to select correct machine learning model for give data and how to boost accuracy by using popular ML model XGBoost.
